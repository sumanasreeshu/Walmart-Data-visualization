# **Walmart Sales Analysis**
This dashboard is all about digging into the data behind Walmart's performance across different stores over three years. By looking at weekly sales alongside factors like CPI (Consumer Price Index), unemployment rates, and temperature trends, it offers insights into how various conditions might impact Walmart's sales. This project is a helpful tool for anyone interested in understanding the bigger picture behind store performance.

**Project Overview**

This project started with a question: how do external factors like the economy and weather influence Walmart's sales across stores? Using three years of store-level data (2010–2012), this dashboard brings together weekly sales data with CPI, unemployment, and temperature information to see how they all interact. It's a straightforward but powerful way to visualize trends, spot patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions about Walmart's sales dynamics.

**Data Source**

File: Walmart.csv (contains all raw data)  
Metrics: Weekly Sales, CPI (Consumer Price Index), Unemployment, Average Temperature  
Period: 2010 to 2012, broken down by store and week
Scope: Data for each Walmart store, capturing weekly performance and local conditions  
Project Objectives
Understand how weekly sales vary by store and year.
See if changes in CPI or unemployment levels have any effect on sales. Check if temperature trends align with shifts in shopping behavior.
Provide an interactive dashboard where users can quickly explore these patterns.

**Key Findings**  

**Sales Trends:** Sales vary quite a bit across different stores. Some stores consistently perform better than others, and there are visible shifts year over year.   
**CPI Influence:** There's a noticeable connection between CPI levels and weekly sales in some stores, suggesting that sales may be sensitive to price changes in certain areas.  
**Unemployment Trends:** Higher unemployment rates seem to correlate with lower sales in some cases, hinting that local economic conditions may impact spending.
Temperature Patterns: Temperature shifts show some seasonality in sales, with certain weather conditions appearing to affect shopper activity.
Using the Dashboard
Here’s a quick guide to getting the most out of each section in the dashboard:
**Weekly Sales & CPI:**  
This chart breaks down weekly sales by store, using color (from red to green) to show the sales volume—green means higher sales.
It’s easy to spot which stores are performing well over time and which ones might be struggling.  
**Average Unemployment:**
Unemployment data is visualized per store and year. Each year has a different color (2010 is blue, 2011 is orange, and 2012 is red), making it easy to track changes.
You can see how shifts in unemployment might relate to sales dips or peaks in specific stores.   
**Average Temperature:**  
This dot plot shows the average temperature at each store location, helping to identify any seasonal patterns.
It’s a helpful visual for understanding how weather trends could be influencing shopping habits across the year.

**Conclusions**
The Walmart Sales Analysis Dashboard offers a big-picture view of how factors like CPI, unemployment, and temperature can impact sales. it’s for seeing connections and building strategies. For anyone looking to make data-driven decisions—whether it’s about pricing, marketing, or inventory—this dashboard brings the data to life, making it easier to plan for future fluctuations.
